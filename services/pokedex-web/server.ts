// TypeScript, run directly: Node strips the types at load time, so
// there is no build step, no bundler and no dist/ - the container still
// runs `node server.ts` and the distroless image needs nothing extra.
//
// Stripping is not checking. `npm run typecheck` is what actually
// verifies these types, and CI runs it before the tests.
//
// Few annotations below, deliberately: Fastify ships its own types and
// infers request, reply and hook parameters from the route it is
// attached to. Spelling them out adds nothing a reader does not get from
// hovering, and gives the next person something to keep in sync.
