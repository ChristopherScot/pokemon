// timeout, no retry and no breaker - the defaults are the point.
//
// A caller of this service gets the generated api.Client, which speaks
// the protocol and nothing else: ogen deliberately ships no retries, no
// timeout and no breaker. Its only extension point is WithClient, which
// takes anything with a Do method - so this supplies the parts that
// decide how the service behaves when a dependency is slow or failing.
