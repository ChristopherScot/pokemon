// THIS WHOLE REPO IS YOURS. A CLI has no config.yaml, so `regen`,
// `render`, `check` and `vault` do not apply to it - `init` scaffolded
// these files once and nothing rewrites any of them. Edit freely.
//
// Two couplings survive that, and neither is checked at build time:
//
//   - VERSION drives releases. CI publishes only when its first line
//     changes on main, tagging what it says. Bump it in the commit that
//     should ship; a change without one builds and releases nothing.
//   - update.go downloads `pokedex-cli_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` from the
//     latest GitHub release. CI builds assets with exactly that name.
//     Rename either side and self-update fails against a release that
//     looks fine on GitHub - so change both together, or neither.
//
// Because nothing regenerates this, a later convention change in
// homelabctl will not reach it. That is the trade for the repo being
// yours: `init` is a starting point, not a template you stay attached
// to.
